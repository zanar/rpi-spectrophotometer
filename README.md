# rpi-spectrophotometer
3D printed cheap RPi based spectrophotometer

## The Idea

### Origin

The original idea come from [here](http://blog.durablescope.com/post/BuiltASpectrometer/) (source code [here](https://github.com/tonbut/RPiSpectrometer)) and I thought about improving it: from [spectrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometer) to [spectrophotometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrophotometry) and using 3D printed parts for a better hardware.

These improvments increase the cost, but I'll try to keep it low.

### Forecast

I'd like to make it controllable locally (with a touch-screen) or remotly (via a http server).
Some GUI will be needed for that.

## The Sources

I'll share here the sources of the 3D parts, the softwares and all needed elements.
Some of them will be derived from the work of other people. I'll notify it, and I want to thanks them for it. All the credit of their work is theirs.

The 3D parts are made with [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/). 

As said in the [License](LICENSE), the sources are provided as-is, and the 3D parts will evolve. Print them at your risks and prefers the tagged versions.
